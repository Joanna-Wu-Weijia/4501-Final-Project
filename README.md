# Uber and Taxi Data Analysis with Weather Correlation (2020-2024)

## Project Description
This project investigates the relationship between Uber and taxi ridership data and weather patterns from 2020 to 2024. The analysis includes data cleaning, processing, visualization, and statistical insights into how weather impacts ride demand. The project utilizes Python for data manipulation and visualization, leveraging popular libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. 

This project aims to answer questions such as:
- How do weather conditions (temperature, precipitation) affect ride demand?
- Are there seasonal or hourly trends in Uber and taxi rides in relation to weather?
